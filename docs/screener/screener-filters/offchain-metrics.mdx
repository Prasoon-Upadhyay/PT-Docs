# Offchain Metrics

Off-chain metrics come from sources external to the blockchain, typically from exchanges or trade data. These include:

## Tradebook Count

Represents the number of buy or sell orders executed within a certain time, categorized by size (e.g., `buy_count_0_1k`).

## Tradebook Volume

The cumulative volume of buy or sell orders, grouped by trade size (e.g., `buy_vol_0_1k`).
