# Two-Way Syncing

## Workbench and Dashboard Sync in PANDA Terminal

When you add a workbench (WB) to the dashboard, the original workbench remains unchanged, even as you make adjustments within the dashboard.

This gives you the freedom to experiment without altering your core workbench data.

You can use the two-way sync feature to apply those changes back to the original and vice versa. This seamless sync ensures your workbench stays updated with improved insights or configurations.
