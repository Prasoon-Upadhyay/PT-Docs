# Workbench to Dashboard

Just like you can sync changes from the dashboard to the original workbench, the process works the other way around too. If you've made adjustments or added new insights directly in your workbench, and you want those updates to be reflected in the dashboard, Panda Terminal makes it easy to sync these changes.

## Steps to sync Main Workbench to Dashboard Workbench:

1.  Make your desired changes to the workbench view, and save it.
    ![Workbench-Dashboard Sync-I](./../../../assets/images/wb-to-db-1.avif)
2.  You will be prompted with the list of all the workbenches imported in the dashboard linked to the main workbench.  
     ![Workbench-Dashboard Sync-II](./../../../assets/images/wb-to-db-2.avif)
3.  Simply, toggle on the dashboard workbench views that you wish to reflect the change on.
4.  Click 'Save', and your changes are successfully reflected on the dashboard.
