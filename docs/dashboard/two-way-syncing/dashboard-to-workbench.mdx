# Dashboard to Workbench

When you import a saved workbench view to the dashboard, a copy of it is created which is independent of the main workbench. Any changes made inside the dashboard workbench can be synced to the main workbench that it is created with.

## Steps to sync a Dashboard Workbench to the Main Workbench view:

1. Import your wb into the dashboard.  
   :::note
   A working copy of your main workbench view is created.
