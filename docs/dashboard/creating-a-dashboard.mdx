# Creating Your First Dashboard

If you havenâ€™t yet created any dashboards of your own, follow these steps to get started:

1. **Locate the Top Panel**  
   Look for the plus icon (`+`) on the top panel, where all your created dashboards are displayed.

2. **Click the Plus Icon**  
   Click on the plus icon to initiate the creation of a new dashboard. This will prompt you to name the dashboard.

3. **Dashboard Creation**  
   Once created, the new dashboard will automatically display two screens by default.

You can change the default layout and number of tabs in a chart by locating
the 'layout' icon beside the command line inside the dashboard.
