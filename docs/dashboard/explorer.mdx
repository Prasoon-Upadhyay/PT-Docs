# Explorer

Located at the top-right section, the Explorer is your central hub for all view combinations in PANDA Terminal. It provides access to:

## Personal Views

A collection of all your saved, customized views, including PANDA Intel, workbench, screener, and dashboards. Quickly access any route by selecting your saved templates.

## Published Views

Contains all templates you’ve published. Make edits, review changes, or delete any as needed.

## Shared Access

Access read-only views shared privately with you.

## Community

Browse public & private templates published within the PANDA Terminal community.

The community publishes can be differentiated by the access each user holds:

- **Green lock**: Public templates you have access to.
- **Red lock**: Public templates you don’t have access to.
- **No lock**: Templates open to all PANDA Terminal users.

Find all your views—personal, shared, and community—in one place. Explore public collections and easily clone templates to enhance your trading experience.
