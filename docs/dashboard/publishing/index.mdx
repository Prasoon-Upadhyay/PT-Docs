# Publishing

You can publish your ideas to PANDA Terminal users and communities via the Explorer Section.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Create and Save** the template you wish to share.
2. **Navigate to Explorer** and locate your saved template.
3. **Hover over the template** and click “Publish”.
4. **Create a clear title and engaging description** to capture attention. Explain not just what your idea is, but why it matters.
5. **Add smart tags** to make your idea easier to find (optional).
6. **Choose your audience**—keep it public or restrict it to specific communities or users.

Published ideas are visible in the Community Section of the explorer. If a user doesn’t have access, the idea will appear locked.

## Cloning

Users with access can clone the template, creating a customizable copy in their account.

We look forward to seeing your published ideas and making the PANDA Terminal community a positive place to publish ideas, grow, and meet others.
