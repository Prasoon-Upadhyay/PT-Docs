# Choosing Audience

When you choose to publish any template, it appears in the community section of the 'Explorer' for all users. Depending on the permissions, they are able to view only the templates they have access to.

<video width="800" height="500" autoPlay loop>
  <source src={ChoosingAudienecVid} type="video/mp4"></source>
</video>

1. **If you choose to share it with All PANDA Terminal users**, then all users have the access to view and clone the template.

2. **If you choose to share it with Selected audience**, then only the users or community that you add will be able to access it.
