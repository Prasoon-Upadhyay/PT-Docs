# Overview

Dashboards let you combine workbenches, screeners, and other elements into custom layouts. Track, analyze entities, and market metrics in one place, with full control over how you organize and monitor your data.

While individual entities have dedicated profile pages, Dashboards provide a consolidated view, giving you full control over how you organize and interact with your data.
