# Connecting your Wallet

To get started to trade DEX, you will need to set up a wallet that supports the blockchain you would like to trade on.

:::info
By default, PANDA Terminal creates an embedded wallet linked to your account. When you navigate to the DEX page for the first time, this embedded wallet will be displayed.

To start using the default wallet, copy your wallet address and deposit funds using external wallets. The exact same process can be used to trade using default wallet also.
