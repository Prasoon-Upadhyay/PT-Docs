## Order Type

- **Market Order**: A market order is where a trader buys or sells a position at the current market price. It prioritizes execution speed over price, meaning the trade will be executed as quickly as possible at the prevailing market price. Due to changes in market depth, the final average price of execution may experience price slippage.

- **Limit Order**: A limit order is an instruction to buy or sell a security at a specified price or better. Unlike market orders, which execute immediately at the current market price, limit orders allow you to set the price at which you're willing to trade. For a buy order, the trade will execute at the limit price or lower; for a sell order, it will execute at the limit price or higher. However, execution is not guaranteed if the market doesnâ€™t reach your set price.

## Estimate Position Profit or Loss

- **Long position**: If the price rises, you earn a profit. If the price falls, you suffer a loss.

  With 10x leverage, if the price rises by 10%, your profit increases by 100% (10% multiplied by 10x leverage). However, if you employ 10x leverage and the maintenance margin fraction for this pair is 1.5%, a price drop of 8.5% results in a 100% loss [(8.5% + 1.5%) multiplied by 10x], leading to the liquidation of your position.

- **Short position**: If the price falls, you earn a profit. If the price rises, you suffer a loss.

  With 1x leverage, if the price drops by 10%, your profit increases by 10%. However, if you're using 1x leverage and the maintenance margin fraction for this pair is 1.5%, a price increase of 98.5% will result in a 100% loss [(98.5% + 1.5%) * 1x], causing your position to be liquidated.

## Close a Position
