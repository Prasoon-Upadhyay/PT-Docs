# Sharing

Panda Terminal allows you to easily share your Workbench views and Panda Intel charts with others, enabling quick collaboration between users.

## How Sharing Works:

- **Share Your Views and Analyses**: You can share your customized Workbench views and Panda Intel charts with other users.
- **Read-Only Access**: Shared content is in view-only mode. Recipients can see your work but cannot edit or modify anything.

- **Secure Collaboration**: This ensures your original configurations remain unchanged while others can benefit from your insights.

Your work remains secure, as others cannot alter your settings or data.
