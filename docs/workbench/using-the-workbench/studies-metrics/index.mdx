# Studies / Metrics

You can combine one or more specific metrics in the studies toggle.

You can create two or more studies, save the configuration, and then switch to that view from the options provided to you, creating a view tailored to your use case.

Every metric that you add gets integrated into the chart and can be used for comparison.
