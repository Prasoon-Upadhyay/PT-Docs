# Studies

Studies are technical indicators that you add to charts from the Studies menu.

To add a study to a chart, select the study from the Studies menu.

To quickly find a study, enter the study name in the search field. As you enter the name, the list of studies is reduced to just those names that include the characters you entered.

Studies can overlay charts or appear in panels above or below charts. By default, some studies appear as overlays, and some appear in panels.

## Study Parameter Dialogues

Many settings can be adjusted in each study. Below are
descriptions of common parameters that appear in many studies:

| **Period**           | Specifies the number of bars incorporated in the study’s calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Field**            | Specifies the input series for the study calculation. Users can select from different components of price bars (open, high, low, close, adjusted close), or calculations of those components (hl/2, hlc/3…). Users may also select from studies or comparison series currently on the chart. |
| **Type**             | Specifies the type of Moving Average incorporated in the study’s calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Panel**            | Specifies which chart panel the study appears in. Panels are listed in vertical order as they appear on the chart.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Show as underlay** | Sets the study behind the main study or series in its panel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Y-axis**           | Specifies where and how the study’s Y-axis appears in the panel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
