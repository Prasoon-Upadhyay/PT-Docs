## Indicator Details:

- **Indicator Condition** — The condition you want to view the indicator for. It is used to display events, which allows users to add signals for historical evaluation as well as ongoing analysis.
- **Chart Marker / Indicator Display Settings** — Appears as a circle, diamond, or square to indicate when a signal occurs. Shape color is user-selectable via a color picker and can include a single-character label. Clicking a marker opens the related study panel or shows/hides the study if it is on the primary series (see previous chart).
